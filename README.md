# java-beginnings-class9

Welcome to my **Class 9 Java Programs** repository—my first year diving into computer science using Java and BlueJ.

##  What I Learned

This year marked the start of my computational thinking and programming journey. I learned:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals**
  - Concepts like _Classes_ and _Objects_, and how they model data and behavior
- **Variables & Data Types**
  - Primitive types and variable handling in Java
- **Operators & Math Library**
  - Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators; using Java’s `Math` class
- **Control Structures**
  - Writing **if-else**, **switch**, and looping constructs (`for`, `while`, including nested loops)

These were key building blocks that paved my way into programming.

##  Contents

| Folder/File            | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `SimplePrograms/`      | Basic algorithms: prime checks, factorial, Fibonacci series |
| `LoopPatterns/`        | Pattern printing using nested loops |
| `ConditionalExamples/` | Programs using `if-else`, `switch`, edge case handling |
| `OOPBasics/`           | Classes like `BankAccount.java`, encapsulating behavior and state |

##  Why It Matters

These programs aren't just homework—they represent the **moment I first coded logic**, turned abstract ideas into working programs, and discovered my passion for problem-solving through code.
